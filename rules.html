    <h1><strong>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</em></h2>
    <article>
        <p>  Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants,
             spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, 
             and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used
              is properly prepared for operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical
               Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.</p>

        <p> Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current
            technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety
            standards possible.</p>

        <p>National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules.
             In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.</p>

    <li><strong>Convertibles</strong></li>
    <p>It is highly recommended that all convertible vehicles be equipped with an aftermarket roll bar that meets
         or exceeds the standards set in the Time Trials Safety Standard Level 2 (see below). However, minimum safety
          standards requires the vehicle meets at least one of the following criteria and is not subject to any of the
           listed exceptions:</p>
           <ol>
           <li><strong>Convertible vehicles up to and including the 2005 model year</strong> must have rollover protection meeting one
             of the following criteria:</li>
           <ol type="A">
               <li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory installed roll over protection. 
                (Examples of manufacturer-documented roll over protection include hydroformed and reinforced a-pillars 
                or windshield frame and factory installed roll bars and/or “pop-up” bars that are designated as roll over 
                protection.)</li>
               <li>The vehicle is equipped with a commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described by the manufacturer
                 to provide track-appropriate rollover protection. (E.g., “style” bars are not acceptable.)
               </li>
               <li>The vehicle is equipped with a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material and construction.</li>
           </ol>
           <li><strong>Convertible vehicles of the 2006 model year or later</strong> must have a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards
             for material and construction unless one of the following criteria is met.</li>
          <ol type="A">
              <li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory-installed roll over protection or a commercially produced roll bar
                 or roll cage which is described by the manufacturer to provide track-appropriate rollover protection.</li>
              <li>The vehicle is six (6) cylinders, with the OE drivetrain and may only be naturally aspirated.
              </li>

              <p><strong>Note:</strong> This means that for 2006+ vehicles, if the engine is not the original equipment model as delivered in 
                that vehicle,  aftermarket forced induction has been installed, or the vehicle has more than six (6) cylinders or six
                 (6) cylinders and forced induction of any type, the vehicle must have aftermarket rollover protection or documented
                  factory rollover protection.</p>

    <li><strong>SAFETY LEVEL 2</strong></li>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Overview</strong></li>
        <p>Safety Level 2 generally means a 4-point roll bar,
             5-point racing harness, arm restraints or window net, and fire-retardant helmets and clothing.</p>
        <p>For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 treadwear
             or beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with modified or aftermarket
              fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.</p>
        <p>All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards, plus the additions below.</p>
        <li><strong>Vehicle</strong></li>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Roll Bars</strong></li>
        <p>These specifications apply to all vehicles (other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19).
             Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover
              structure or comply with the following specifications.</p>
        <p>A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind the driver and supplemented by two braces.
             The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from the weight of the car coming down
              on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from the car skidding along the ground on the
               roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over.
                Roll bars must meet the following criteria:</p>
            </ol>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>One continuous length of tubing must be used for the hoop member with smooth continuous
                     bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure.</li>
                <li>The top of the roll bar must be above the top of the driver&#8217;s helmet when the driver is in
                     normal driving position.</li>
                <li>The two (2) vertical members forming the sides of the hoop must be more than 15 inches apart
                     (inside dimension), and it is desirable that it extend the full width of the cockpit.</li>
                <li>An inspection hole of at least 3/16 inch diameter to facilitate verification of wall thickness may be required.
                     It must be drilled in a non-critical area of a roll bar member at least three inches from any weld or bend.</li>
                <li>All bolts and nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 or better, 5/16-inch minimum diameter.</li>
                <li>Braces and portions of the main hoop subject to contact by the driver&#8217;s or passenger&#8217;s helmet,
                     as seated normally and restrained by seatbelt and harness, must be padded with a non-resilient material
                      such as Ethafoam® or Ensolite® or other similar material with a minimum thickness of 1/2 inch.
                       Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended.</li>
                <li>The size of tubing to be used for the main hoop, braces and diagonals shall be determined on the basis
                     of the weight of the car. The following minimum sizes are required and are based upon the weight of the
                      car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal; 0.010-inch variation in wall thickness is allowed.</li>

                      </table>
                      <li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel
                         tubing (SAE 1010, 1020, 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130).
                          For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing ERW tubing is acceptable.</li>
                          <li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration.
                             Craters should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                          <li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction
                             with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces
                              must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop.
                               Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to
                                prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the
                                 hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing
                                  the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable),
                                   there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the
                                    installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side
                                     to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with
                                      a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as
                                       a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                          <li>Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to
                             be at least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube
                              to facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent
                               mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope
                                section must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded
                                 to the main hoop.</li>
                          <li>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible.
                             Mounting plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                          <li>In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be used to secure
                             the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be distributed
                              over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be used on the
                               opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together.</li>
                          <li>Mounting plates bolted to the structure shall not be less than 0.1875 inch thick and the use of a
                             back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted
                              together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for bolted mounting plates.</li>
